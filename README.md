# My Personal Website

This is my personal but professional website that showcases my journey and expertise as a Software Test Engineer, Quality Engineer, and Test Automation Engineer. Through this website, I aim to share my professional experience, projects, talks, and thoughts about software testing and quality engineering.

## How do I access this website?
You can find it [here](https://abhivaikar.github.io/)

## How did I build this website?
I forked the [Github Personal Website Template](https://github.com/github/personal-website) and hosted it on Github Pages.

It is heavily customized to my needs and preferences. Feel free to use it as a template for your own website to showcase your work and skills as a tester / quality engineer / SDET.
